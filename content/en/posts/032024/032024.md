# Random Topics


## Intro
- I feel like I didn't accomplish much this month. This monthly blog helped me realize I managed to do at least something.


## Austria Skiing

We visited Restaurant Week for the second time. This time we selected [Hong Kong Karlin](https://hongkongkarlin.cz/). The food itself was okay, but the staff was slow, and the food came colder than expected. We were also hungry after the whole fine dining thing, so we needed to go to McDonald's to eat something more. It seems like we are the only ones with this issue (this happened for the second time) as Reddit users are finding other reasons for why a person can be hungry after fine dining:

> Maybe you were actually just thirsty! I heard that people can mistake thirst for hunger.

> Maybe you‚Äôre eating a lot of processed carbs.

I learned that according to Thomas Keller (American chef):

> "Our whole menu is based on the law of diminishing returns. The most compelling portion of a dish is in the first three or four bites. With the first bite you're getting into it, by the second bite you start to realize it, and it is at the third or fourth bites you get the maximum appreciation and pleasure from that dish...and you keep eating because of that memory of it being really extraordinary. But was it as good [at the end] as it was at that second, third, or fourth bite? No."

> His solution? Smaller portions. Don't allow yourself to keep eating and eating trying to recapture that early blush of pleasure. The time to stop is when you still are so excited by a dish that you want a little more.

Well, good, but it seems we are just used to much more food :( :D.

## Random Memory about Cactus Fights in Czechia

I remember a drama with Czech cactus growers and the Czech government as the Czech government decided to confiscate and kill all the cactuses that might be psychoactive. There were petitions against this nonsense as it's next to impossible to grow cactuses in Czechia in a way to produce any interesting yield of alkaloids. 

One of the prominent cactus growers even gave the best cactuses for analysis so it can be shown they do not contain any high numbers of alkaloids.

 Just in case, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, and a few others were neutral countries during WWII.

# Things Happen
- Advice for a mentee who does not like to read
    - Our investment in reading changes the book because the book has changed us. ... If books are merely a means of transferring information, then perhaps, yes, a book is a waste of time. If a summary of its thesis and key points could be presented in a brief article or Substack post, why not just save the hours and read the Substack post? All the more if the information is outdated or questionable for one reason or another. But that mistakes what a book is for. A book is a tool. It‚Äôs a machine for thinking. And ‚Äúall machines,‚Äù as Thoreau once said, ‚Äúhave their friction.‚Äù The time it takes to engage with ideas‚Äîwhether factual or fictional, emotional or intellectual, accurate or inaccurate, efficient or inefficient‚Äîmight strike some as a drag. But the time given to working through those ideas, adopting and adapting, developing or discarding, changes our minds, changes us. It‚Äôs not about the wisdom we glean. It‚Äôs about what wisdom we grow.‚Äù ‚Äî Joel Miller [Source](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-24-2024/)
