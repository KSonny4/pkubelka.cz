It’s like we’re gaslighting each other into believing that the endless pursuit of more resources is a good life-strategy.

The best career advice that I learned is don’t ever attach your-self to a PERSON, a place, a company, an organization or a project. Only Attach your-self to your mission in life and your PURPOSE. That’s how you keep your power and keep your peace! Surround your self with people who LIKE YOU FOR YOU
