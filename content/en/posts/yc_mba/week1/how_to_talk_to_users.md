        - How to interview
            - Video, phone, or in-person. Body language gives a lot of info
            - Build rapport
            - **Don't introduce your product**
              - this might bias their answers
            - Listen, don't talk
            - Ask open-ended questions
            - Take notes
        - Example interview
            - Do you care about carbon emmisions? Yes, consultant creates PDF once a year
            - What do you do with PDFs? Nothing, info is dense and they do not understand it
            - Tell me more about it - Seems they need expert to let then understand the data
        - Questions to ask potential customers
            - Tell me how you do x today
            - What is the hardest thing about doing x?
            - Why is it hard?
            - How often do you have to do x?
            - Why is it important for your company to do x?
            - What do you do to solve this problem yourself?
        - If we can watch and they can show us how they solve the problem - this is the best - Ask follow up questions
            - What do you mean by that?
            - Can you tell me more about that?
            - Why is that important to you?
        - Don't ask these questions
            - Will you use our product?
            - Which features would make our product better?
            - Yes/no questions
            - How would a better product look like to you?
            - Two questions at the same time
    - Next steps
        - synthesize your learnings
        - create problem/solution hypothesis
        - Start sketching MVP
    - Test that the problem is valuable
        - Are people paying money for solutions in this space today? - other companies solving this?
        - Have you tried to solve this problem on your own? Excel? To move them from Excel, it needs to be better
        - Some customers will always be easier than others to do research on. Selling to plumbers harder than to startups
        - Hand the MVP to customers, don't tell them what to do and watch them. You can tell them smth like "Create a booking on Airbnb" but do not tell them how to exactly solve it
        - Slack group or smth with customers - make them feel specials. Great way to show prototypes
