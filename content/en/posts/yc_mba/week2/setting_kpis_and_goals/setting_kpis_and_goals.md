- Don't focus on Vanity metrics
    - Vanity metrics are data points that may seem impressive at first glance but don't necessarily provide meaningful insights into the performance of a startup or its progress toward its goals. Here are a few examples:
        - Total Downloads/Installs: This metric might seem impressive, but it doesn't necessarily reflect active users or engagement with the product.
        - Website Traffic: High traffic numbers might seem like a good sign, but if those visitors aren't converting into customers or engaging with the product, it's not a reliable indicator of success.
- KPIs and prioritization are important since nobody tells you as a founder how to prioritize your time. It's easy to feel productive and not move business forward
- Examples of feel productive and not move business forward
    - Optimizing paperwork tasks
    - Unnecessary perfectionism
    - Premature optimization
    - picking hard problem and Not building what your users want
- It's easy to run fast in wrong direction
- How to prioritize
    - speed matters
    - align iwth your cofounder 
- Step 1: Indentify top KPIs
    - if you launched, it should be revenue growth
    - non revenue KPI is rarely the good one
    - what is the KPI goal for next week
        - E.g. get 10 customers
    - Early growth compounds
- Step 2: Identify biggest bottleneck
    - SuprDaily company
        - Aka bolt foods
        - Top KPI
            - Growth, bottlenecked by conversion late in the funnel
        - Biggest problem
            - Why are high intent users not converting?
        - Discovered they did not have milk brand so users did not finish the order.
