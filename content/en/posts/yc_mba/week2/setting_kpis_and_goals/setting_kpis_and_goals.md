- If you are startup founder, nobody tells you how you should spend your time
- It's not worth to optimize every metrics
- You want to get to product market fit ASAP, prioritization is crucial
- KPI
    - Key performance indicator
    - Measuring what matters
- Prioritization
    - Infinite things we can do each day, work is never done
    - How i spend the day, how team spends to day
- Prioritize tasks that move you toward your KPIs Faster
- Choose right KPIs and be honest with ourselves
- Don't focus on Vanity metrics
    - Vanity metrics are data points that may seem impressive at first glance but don't necessarily provide meaningful insights into the performance of a startup or its progress toward its goals. Here are a few examples:
        - Total Downloads/Installs: This metric might seem impressive, but it doesn't necessarily reflect active users or engagement with the product.
        - Website Traffic: High traffic numbers might seem like a good sign, but if those visitors aren't converting into customers or engaging with the product, it's not a reliable indicator of success.
- KPIs and prioritization are important since nobody tells you as a founder how to prioritize your time. It's easy to feel productive and not move business forward
- Examples of feel productive and not move business forward
    - Optimizing paperwork tasks
    - Unnecessary perfectionism
    - Premature optimization
    - picking hard problem and Not building what your users want
- It's easy to run fast in wrong direction
- How to prioritize
    - speed matters
    - align iwth your cofounder 
- Step 1: Indentify top KPIs
    - if you launched, it should be revenue growth
    - non revenue KPI is rarely the good one
    - what is the KPI goal for next week
        - E.g. get 10 customers
    - Early growth compounds
- Step 2: Identify biggest bottleneck
    - SuprDaily company
        - Aka bolt foods
        - Top KPI
            - Growth, bottlenecked by conversion late in the funnel
        - Biggest problem
            - Why are high intent users not converting?
        - Discovered they did not have milk brand so users did not finish the order. 

- Simple system to move your KPI(s)
    - 01 Write down ideas that may help
        - Rank & choose a few (rank few and subrank according to how long it will take)
    - 02 If your KPI doesn't move, be honest on why
    - 03 Do honest retros; learn and adjust course
        - If it wasn't working, do something different
        - If it was working, double down
    - 04 Move fast
        - Learn and do something differently if the stuff so far did not work. The definition of insanity is doing over and over again the same stuff and expect different results.
        - don't let indicision to block you, just choose one path and go with it.
- Things that should be on your list
    - Talking to users / responding to customer support messages
        - the only way you know what customers want is by talking with them all the time
    - Building features you know your customers will pay for
    - Getting users to pay for what you've built

- Things that should probably not be on your list AKA fake progress
    - Investor "coffees"
    - Conferences
    - Arbitrary technical milestones 
        - AKA launching Android app unless its smth users explicitly asked for
- Common mental traps (things that makes are feel good but does not help with Product market fit)
    - Checking things off a list feels good (e.g. optimizing paperwork about processes)
    - It's easy to convince yourself something is working when it's not (easy to mistake slow growth for PMF)
    - Perfectionism and indecision are your enemy: fast decisions are good decisions
        - Most decisions does not matter, and for those that do it's okay to decide wrong and fix it later, just keep moving
        - Nobody make quick decisions all the time, second best option pretty good decisions quickly and if wrong, fix
        - don't waste time on decisions that does not get you to PMF
        - if it's a tough call, it actually probably measn you can't go wrong
    - Mitigating downside (rather than chasing upside) can feel falsely urgent
        - Downside risk protection is straightforward, and fixing small problems can be incredibly gratifying.
    - Working on secondary problems instead of the existential one
- Prioritization Recap
    - You'll never get to everything on your task list
    - Use KPIs to prioritize your work
    - Be honest with yourself; fail fast
- How to choose good KPIs
    - Primary Metric
        - This is the metric that unequivocally tells you if your business is working
        - Most commonlv revenue growth
    - Secondary Metric(s)
        - Things that need to be tracked to make sure you're not cheating/gaming your primary metric
        - Examples
            - Retention/churn
            - Unit economics
            - Acquisition cost and payback period
        - Vanity Metrics
            - Amount raised
            - Team size
            - Office space
            - Press hits
            - Celebrity endorsements
            - Instagram likes
- Main message: Choose your primary KPIs
- How do we set targets? How much growth is enough?
    - 5-7% WoW (Week over Week) = good
    - 10% WoW = exceptional
- Early growth matters
    - Growth rate compounds
- Factors to consider
    - Latent demand may boosts early growth
    - Length of sales cycle
    - Organic vs. paid
    - Retention/Engagement
- Customers that placed 5+ orders are muuuuuuch better metric than signups

- when setting targets, two approaches
    - Top down
        - Pick a milestone/date in the future that you want/need to hit
        - Work backwards from this for bi-weekly goals
    - Bottoms up
        - What is realistic for you to get done next week?
        - Work up from this to determine a realistic future milestone
- non-revenue kpis, might be tempting but not right
    - CAC/LTV - customer acquisition cost / lifetime value
        - Focus on payback period
        - post PMF
        - now worry at the start only at payback period
    - Free signups / daily active users (DAUs)
        - only exception is if your product requires a network effect
- Exception to revenue KPIs
    - Hard tech, rockets, biomed..
