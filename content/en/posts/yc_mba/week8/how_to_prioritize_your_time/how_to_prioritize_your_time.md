- Time burns money, and money is the very basic thing that keeps startup alive
- You need to be really good in identifiing and analyzing high importance tasks
- there are 24 hours in a day, everyone has different situation, but we need to allocate the time here somehow
    - Excercise
    - Family
    - Friends
    - Hobbies
    - Sleep
    - Startup
- Real vs. Fake progress
    - Easiest way to classify it I should do smth or not
    - seems trivial at first, why would anyone do smth that is not real progress?
    - Primary KPI: Revenue / Active users
    - You should always set weekly goal for primary KPI
        - Talking to users
        - Building the product
        - NOTHING ELSE
    - Fake progress
        - Winning awards
        - Conferences
        - Lots of advisors
        - Pitch competitions
        - Press announcements
        - Forbes Everyone Under 30
        - Networking events
        - Twitter activity
        - Meeting famous people
        - Optimizing BS metrics
    - It should be about delivering real value to users, not Delivering points to your ego
- Task prioritization
    - it's easy for low value work to creep into your work
    - Experiment: try journaling every hour what is it you are doing - be honest with what you expect the impact will be and what it was
    - we tend to be as humans on autopilot - we are not minding where we invest the time. We love to cross the stuff out of todolist
    - log tasks in spreadsheat - it should be either in category Talking to users or Building the product
    - Dimensions 
        - Impact of weekly goals: high, medium, low
        - Complexity: Easy (less than day), medium (few days), hard (many days)
    - Very common mistake tech founders do is build things first and talk to users later.
- Example tasks in table

| Task                                       | Impact | Complexity |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|------------|
| In-person demo to 10 warm intros           | High    | Medium     |
| Video demo to 10 customer leads            | Medium  | Easy       |
| Add chat widget to website                 | Medium  | Easy       |
| Cold email 1000 potential users            | Medium  | Medium     |
| Get feedback from users re: big feature X  | Medium  | Medium     |
| Improve website copy                       | Low     | Easy       |
| Re-write section of code for better speed  | Low     | Hard       |
| Coding for big feature X                   | Low     | Hard       |

- sorted by impact and complexity, you should do the high impact and easy first, than high impact and medium
- You do not want to focus on the low things - no point do to hits
- Focus on High/Easy, High/Medium
- Avoid Low/Hard, Low/Medium 
- Don't do too many things at
- How well am I prioritizing?
    - write weekly updates
        - Primary KPI (Actual vs Goal)
        - Biggest obstacle to growth
        - Tasks accomplished + impact
        - Big learnings

    - Once in a while you should review your weekly updates
        - Learning fast?
        - Predicting impact well?
        - Low value work creep in?
        - Consistent blockers to growth?
        - Completing tasks in timely manner?
    - If you are always running out of time to complete tasks, two suggestions:
        - maybe task is too big and need to be break out into smaller tasks
        - your schedule needs to be rigid a little bit
