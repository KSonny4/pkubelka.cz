- Time burns money, and money is the very basic thing that keeps startup alive
- You need to be really good in identifiing and analyzing high importance tasks
- there are 24 hours in a day, everyone has different situation, but we need to allocate the time here somehow
    - Excercise
    - Family
    - Friends
    - Hobbies
    - Sleep
    - Startup
- Real vs. Fake progress
    - Easiest way to classify it I should do smth or not
    - seems trivial at first, why would anyone do smth that is not real progress?
