# Never Split The Difference

Never Split the Difference, written by former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, teaches you how to negotiate effectively in any situation. Here's a summary of the book's key lessons:

## Mastering Empathy
The book emphasizes the importance of active listening and using verbal techniques like mirroring and labeling emotions to build rapport and understanding with the other negotiator.

## Labeling Emotions
By acknowledging the other party's feelings, you can build trust and de-escalate tension.

## Mirroring
Repeating back key words or phrases shows that you're paying attention and can help guide the conversation.

## Calibrated Questions
Don't just ask yes or no questions. Use open ended questions to gather information and steer the other party towards revealing their true needs.

## The Power of Silence
Don't be afraid of silence. Let the other person fill the void and give away information by talking.

## Never Split the Difference
This tactic avoids saying yes or no to an offer. Instead, acknowledge the offer and ask for clarification or a better proposal.

## Using Silence and Labels to Get "Yes" Answers
By strategically using silence and labels, you can encourage the other party to elaborate and eventually agree to your terms.

## Odd numbers
- Rounded numbers (e.g., $40,000) feel arbitrary and easily countered.
- Odd, specific numbers (e.g., $37,621) seem more calculated and thought-out.
- Psychologically, the odd number feels like it was arrived at through careful analysis, making it a less movable target for the other negotiator. It anchors the negotiation at a specific point that you've established through deliberate consideration.
- So, next time you're negotiating a salary, a price, or any other quantifiable term, consider using an odd number to strengthen your position.
