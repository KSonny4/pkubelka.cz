- Server cap na 600 kvůli izolepe
- “10% of our players were just logging in to chat,” Mod Fetzki (Christoph Vietzke, Head of RuneScape, Jagex, 2005–2012) says. “They wouldn’t even load the game. They’d just sit in the lobby and chat.”
- With the move to RuneScape 2, new hires to the Content Development teams were often given their own area of map to develop. In part, this was because Jagex didn’t have version control until much later down the line. As a result, everyone was making additions and changes to one version of RuneScape. Having developers spread out across the map prevented people from stepping on
  each other’s toes.  
- The Sandwich Lady was based on a 'slightly aggressive' woman who came to Jagex's St John's Innovation Centre office23 and often interrupted work.
  "She would come around shouting 'Sandwiches!' as she pushed her trolley through the office," Mod Ash remembers. "We couldn't do a trolley in the game for graphical reasons, so we gave her a tray instead. "Sandwiches, I made these for you' was iconic as a reference to that old lady and her trolley back in St John's."
