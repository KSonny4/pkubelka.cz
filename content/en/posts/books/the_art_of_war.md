- Spies and deception used everywhere through the book.
- Deception and Misdirection: Military strategy relies heavily on creating illusions and manipulating your opponent's perception. This translates to using tactics like feints, appearing weak when strong, and strong when weak, to gain the upper hand.
    - "All warfare is based on deception."
- Adaptability and Opportunity: Warfare is ever-changing, and so should your approach. The ability to adapt to new situations and seize opportunities that arise from chaos is a key theme.
