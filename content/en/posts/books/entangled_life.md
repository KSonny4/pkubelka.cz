Entangled Life by Merlin Sheldrake delves into the fascinating world of fungi, revealing surprising and sometimes bizarre facts about these complex organisms. Here are some of the most interesting stuff:

* **The Wood Wide Web:** Fungi form vast underground networks of interconnected threads called mycelium, which function like an internet for the forest. These networks allow trees and other plants to communicate and share resources.

* **Zombie Ants:**  A specific fungus can hijack the brains of ants, turning them into mindless puppets. The fungus manipulates the ant's behavior, forcing it to climb to a high point and then clamp its jaws onto a leaf. This ensures optimal spore dispersal by the fungus after the ant dies.

* **Glowing Mushrooms:**  Some fungi emit bioluminescence, producing their own light. This can attract insects that help spread spores, or even serve as a lure for prey in some species.

* **Fungal Pharmacy:**  Many medicines, including penicillin, come from fungi.  Fungi are also being explored for their potential in fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

* **Talking Trees:**   Through the fungal network, trees can potentially communicate with each other, sending signals about dangers like insect infestations.

* **Fungal Intelligence:**  While not sentient, fungi exhibit complex behaviors like problem-solving and resource allocation within their networks. Some researchers suggest a form of "distributed intelligence" within the mycelium.

* **Mycophagy:**  Some animals, like termites and squirrels, have a symbiotic relationship with fungi, relying on them to digest their food. 

* **Fungi and the Future:**  Fungi are being explored for various applications -  bioremediation (cleaning up pollution), creating sustainable building materials, and even developing new food sources. 

These are just a few of the many fascinating discoveries about fungi in Entangled Life. The book sheds light on the crucial role these organisms play in the environment and challenges our understanding of the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
