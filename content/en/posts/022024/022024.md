- [The Tail End by Tim Urban](https://medium.com/twosapp/the-tail-end-by-tim-urban-fcb2ed15fd67)
 depressing reminder to find as much time as you can spend with your family. **It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.** Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.

# Games

  ## ✅ Baldur's Gate 3
  I enjoyed the game very much, but I was hasting to finish it as I spent a long time playing this and I wanted to do other stuff. The third act was pretty short and it felt like it was rushed in comparison with other acts.
